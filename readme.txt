Perfect — GitHub Codespaces might be exactly what you need, Mike.

Here’s a full but clear rundown 👇

---

## 🧠 What GitHub Codespaces Is

GitHub Codespaces gives you a **fully configured development environment in the cloud**, accessible through **VS Code in your web browser** (or through the VS Code desktop app if you prefer).

Basically:

> 🧑‍💻 “It’s like giving each student their own cloud laptop with VS Code preinstalled.”

Everything runs on GitHub’s servers — no installation, no admin rights, and no messing with system permissions.

---

## 🧰 What You Get

* A **VS Code interface** (same as local VS Code)

* Full **Linux container** as a backend (Ubuntu by default)

* Integrated **terminal**

* You can preinstall tools:

  * Java, Python, Node.js, C#, .NET SDK, etc.
  * Databases (e.g. SQLite, PostgreSQL)
  * SDKs, CLI tools, and extensions

* Students can:

  * Write and run code
  * Commit/push to GitHub
  * Debug directly in browser
  * Use terminals and extensions

---

## 🪄 How It Works for You (as Instructor)

1. **Create a GitHub repo** for your course (e.g. `java-sql-labs`).
2. Add a folder: `.devcontainer/`
3. Inside, add two files:

   * `devcontainer.json` → defines environment setup
   * `Dockerfile` → defines what’s installed inside the container

Example:

```jsonc
// .devcontainer/devcontainer.json
{
  "name": "Java + JDBC Lab",
  "build": { "dockerfile": "Dockerfile" },
  "settings": {
    "terminal.integrated.shell.linux": "/bin/bash"
  },
  "extensions": [
    "vscjava.vscode-java-pack",
    "ms-python.python",
    "redhat.vscode-yaml"
  ],
  "forwardPorts": [8080],
  "postCreateCommand": "javac -version && java -version",
  "remoteUser": "vscode"
}
```

```dockerfile
# .devcontainer/Dockerfile
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/java:21

# Install SQLite (for SQL practice)
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y sqlite3
```

4. Students visit your repo → click **“Code” → “Open with Codespaces” → “New codespace”**
   → it spins up a ready-to-go environment in about 1–2 minutes.

## 🧑‍🎓 For Students

* Works entirely in the **browser** (even on locked-down PCs)
* Automatically saves their work to GitHub
* No local software needed
* You can push updates to the repo and everyone gets them

---

## 💰 Cost

* **Free for individuals:** up to **60 core-hours per month** and **15 GB of storage**.
* **For classrooms/education:**
  If your institution uses **GitHub Education**, you often get **unlimited Codespaces hours** for students.

## ⚙️ Limitations

* The container is **Linux**, not Windows (so no MS SQL Server directly).
  But you can:

  * Use **SQLite** for SQL practice.
  * Or connect to an external SQL Server (e.g. Azure SQL instance).
* Needs an internet connection.

---

## 🚀 Optional Bonus

Students who prefer a local setup can still:

* Clone the repo locally
* Use the same `.devcontainer` setup in **VS Code with Remote Containers**
* That ensures perfect consistency between local and cloud setups

Would you like me to create a **sample GitHub Codespaces repo** structure for your Java + SQL JDBC lab (with SQLite as a stand-in for SQL Server)?
You could hand that repo to students, and they’d be ready to code instantly.
